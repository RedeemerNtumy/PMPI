One thing I think I also have to work on is the communication between the server and the client PC.It should not be hard coded

The output of the code should be shown on the application and there should be a button that would ask you if you want to quit or create a new mpi cluster
I would have delete all the configurations that were made during the creation of the mpi cluster


When they communicate by the socket, they would have to sleep for some seconds while the other one performs the tasks.

On the client PC, I would have to make that the server so that it would be able to start the connection and wait for the server pc to finish so that it would be abkle to send a message.

When the message is receieved, it would then continue the tasks
